# How to Software Development - Best practices
This repository includes best practises for software development.
This can be a checklist for a code review or a reminder for software developer.

The goal of the best practises is:

1. Changeability of software through:
* Readability -> The code is read far more often than it is written. If you don't understand it, nobody will want to touch it anymore
* Test coverage -> If you want to change the code, there should be tests that certify that the program is still running without errors
* Cooperation -> It is often checked in, programmed together and reviewed: There are no islands of knowledge, so many can change any code area

2. Usefulness includes:
* Effectiveness: What should be created? This question should be at the center of the development process. This question is answered empirically.
* Functional: 100% equivalent test coverage, readable tests and tracing from the requirement to the green tests certify a high level of functionality.
* Efficiency: Don't bother with unnecessary ones and with your IDE
